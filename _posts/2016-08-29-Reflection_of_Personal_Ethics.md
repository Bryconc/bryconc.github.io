Defining my personal system of ethics... You certainly didn't choose an easy topic for an improve speaking exercise. I find it so difficult to nail down an
abstract concept of my ethical process, because I feel like my ethical choices are highly situational. To add unto that I (as well as most people I would assume)
don't actively recognize a thought process when making an ethical judgement. These concepts have become so ingrained in us that it's really just a knee-jerk
reaction. Which, now that I put it into words, seems highly dangerous; we value our ethical beliefs so highly, but we can't even define a logical process to them
(does that make them illogical?).

During my time at ASU I've taken two courses that had a focus in ethics (not counting CS4100); these were my Junior Seminar class and a Philosophy general education
class. In each we discussed three main ethical theories that have come to prominence (Kantianism, Utilitarianism, and Relativism). From the discussion of the three,
I've come to find that my ethical decisions typically align with Kantianism, specifically those of his second categorical imperative, which reads "Act in such a way 
that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end," or more
simply put, treat other people as means in themselves, never as means to an end. 

My personal ethics always find deep roots in respect - respect for myself and respect for others, often prioritizing the latter. If some action would abuse the
rights of another, then I would see it as morally wrong. Albeit, Kant's system of ethics is extremely strict - there is absolutely no room for exceptions. As an ideal this
sounds perfect, there is no confusion over what is right or wrong, but in a practical sense (applying it to how we've come to naturally know an ethical situation), 
it's rather difficult to agree with at all times. Take for instance the example of a white lie: sure we're abusing another's right to the truth, but aren't we sparing
them the painfulness of that truth. Establishing a universal theory of ethics is certainly still a gray area, and I don't know if we'll ever manage to define a concrete solution.
