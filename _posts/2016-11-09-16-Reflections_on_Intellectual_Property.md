<i>Did you learn anything new about the patent process from the presentation or the follow up videos and discussion?</i>

<hr>

Unfortunately I was not able to attend the presentation by Casey Parks on Intellectual Property this week. The solar vehicle team, Team Sunergy, had scheduled a team photo shoot during my CS 4100 class period, and it was required that I attend.Thankfully, I was still able to attend the following class which had supplementary videos and discussions, in the format of Ted Talks.

The first video we viewed was entitled "How I Beat a Patent Troll." The talk was about one man's battle against patent trolls, who are individuals who register patents with generalized concepts with no intention of implementation that threaten to sue people who actually implement the concept. Because there is no real cost or action necessary to register a patent, these trolls can easily register large amounts of patents and thrive off of blackmail. The video suggests a torrid battle of litigation and loopholes that the speaker had to go through in order to beat the troll and squash every threat.

    <figcaption>Drew Curtis, the founder of fark.com, tells the story of how he fought a lawsuit from a company that had a patent, "...for the creation and distribution of news releases via email." Along the way he shares some nutty statistics about the growing legal problem of frivolous patents.</figcaption>

Afterwards we watched "Embrace the Remix," another Ted Talk that focused on some sour accusations about remixed music stealing from original artists. The speaker argues that, in fact, everything is a remix, claiming that every innovation is just a remix on something else that existed beforehand. He argues, and I agree, that progress is made upon the building block of others, not through reinventing the wheel at every turn. We cannot be so concerned about being selfish and unwilling to share, instead we should focus on learning from each other a working together.
