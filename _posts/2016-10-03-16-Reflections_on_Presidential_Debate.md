<i>What did you find most interesting about the discussion surrounding the videos viewed in class today?</i>

<hr>

The Presidential Race of 2016... Oh brother, where to start? I can say this has easily been the most disgusting Presidential Race I have ever seen in my lifetime. This has majorily been an attack on personal character, rather than any stance on personal policy. How have we ended up at this state? Oh well. Best to not dwell on the past, and instead we should figure out how we're going to deal with the future.

This week in class we've had the unforutunate experience of examining some highlights from the this week's Presidential Debate (what a terrible affair!). To keep it in the scope of our class we specifically examined the discussion of cybersecurity. I'll include the video for reference below. Watch it, if you can dare stomach it.

I will say, I am not normally a fan of Secretary Clinton - and to hear her talk about the importance of cybersecurity is painfully ironic - nevertheless, I was quite impressed with her professional, informed response to the topic. She outlined some very key points (i.e. importance of privacy of information, independent hacker groups, etc), and, while they may be general and idealistic, at least they were focused on the topic at hand.

Little can be said for the response of Donald Trump, other than it might one of the worst responses in debate history. First of all, his initial opening, bragging about his endorsements, how is this relevant at all to the question? Moving on, he barely even hints at an answer to the question, instead he remarks that America "came up with the Internet," a rather ridiculous claim in its own remarks. He then goes on to brag about his "a son, he is 10 years old, he has computers, he is so good with these computers, its unbelievable, the security aspect of cyber is very very tough and maybe its not doable." Why on Earth is this being said at a Presidential Debate?

The discussion then devolves into a secondary discussion, which diverts far away from the original question posed. This debate was a massive sham. With terrible candidates and a poor mediator, we could really expect nothing less, as the country watches in agony. The media is more concerned with these personal attacks and mannerisms, instead of actual policies or beliefs.
