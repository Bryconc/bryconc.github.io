<i>Describe your experience trying to uncover information about your classmate and the followup discussion in class.</i>

<hr>

This was probably one of the most interesting assignment specifications I have ever read. Effectively, we were being asked to stalk a fellow classmate. For this assignment I was asked to find information on Mikael Anderson. To make the results of the assignment more accurate, I did not want my browser’s history with Appalachian or the Computer Science department to influence my results, so I used the private browsing mode of Google Chrome.

My gut instinct was to immediately do a Google search with various search terms. These produced mostly fruitless results, since the name was too heavily associated with an axe murderer of the same name, flooding the results with irrelevant information (though highly interesting at least). This proved that I would need to define my search more narrowly if I was to find information. I would need things like a home location or perhaps a middle name, so I would have to find this information elsewhere.

After this I took to social media, specifically FaceBook. While his profile was locked down due to privacy settings, I was able to view his profile picture and use friends’ likes to determine a high probability that Mikael was from Lenoir, or surrounding area. Although I confirmed that this was true later with Mikael, including this in the search parameters did not weed-out these false positive results from before. Perhaps Mikael truely was an axe murderer. Reviewing Mikael's FaceBook privacy settings made me think of my own, where I had little hidden from public view. However, I decided I was not too concerned with this, since none of the information available I found to be incredibly incriminating.

In a last-ditch effort, I attempted to reverse engineer an email from his FaceBook profile, but the applications which claimed to be able to do this failed. They may have been patched out from an old FaceBook bug. If I had found an email address I would have been able to use LeakedSource to determine if any of Mikael’s other accounts had been leaked during any major database hacks. This is an incredible tool I found outside my studies: it tracks large database leaks from major companies and cross references information to determine how many of your accounts have been hit in these leaks. Though it was not useful in this assignment, I continue to use this tool for my own personal security.
