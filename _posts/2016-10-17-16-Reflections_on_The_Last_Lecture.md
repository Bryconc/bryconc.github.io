<i>Make a blog post describing what you took away from the The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch.</i>

<hr>

This week in seminar class, we had the pleasure to watch Randy Pausch's lecture "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams," which later became a book entitled <i>The Last Lecture</i>. Randy Pausch was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who had recently recieved a pronogsis that his pancreatic cancer was terminal. The lecture follows his lifelong advice of following through on your childhood dreams, revealing at the end that the lecture was intended for his children.

This was actually my second time watching this video, the first being in my high school AP Computer Science class. However, it was not until this time around, as a senior in college, that I appreciated it moreso, and I can only imagine that later on in life, if I revisit it, I will take even more from it. Although truly, its message needs to be heard as soon as possible. Taking advantage of opportunity and working to make dreams a reality cannot be put off until later.

Getting to hear him talk about his time as a Disney Imagineer was very nice, especially as he denotes the difficulty that he faced in reaching this position. I know I personally have always been very invested in the Disney company and would love to be a part of such a program. And the fact that he faced many tribulations in making this dream a reality appeals to me, because I can go into this pursuit content with the possibility of failure, knowing that it does not mean I'm not on the right track.

Probably the part that appealed to me the most was his course in virtual reality programming that he had created. Watching the creativity of students take control and drive the success of the class was very inspiring. I only wish that I get to participate in something of that likeness in years to come. I have always appreciated classes that were goal-driven, instead of a broad discussion course. Getting to work with others of a wide skill set, instead of focuses all in programming, would be an amazing experience. It was incredible to see the creations that students had come up with, even if they were a little creepy. Still, it brought something that most computer science classes lack in my opinion: passion.

In his moving presentation, "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams," Pausch talked about his lessons learned and gave advice to students on how to achieve their own career and personal goals. </figcaption>
