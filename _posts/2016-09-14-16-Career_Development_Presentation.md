<i>Topic: Make a blog entry giving the most important take aways from the presentation by Erika Cary from Career Development and the discussion that followed.</i>

<hr>

I would like to start out by thanking presenter/advisor Erika Cary for taking the time to talk to us on Wednesday. I've heard her presentation once before in CS3100 Junior Seminar, but appropriately this presentation was focused on formal job application rather than internship application. Needless to say, a lot of the information that was presented is critical to both processes, and it never hurts to be given a refresher of this advice. Specifically, a reminder of the many services that the university provides in assistance to job searching.

Entering the professional world, especially with high aspirations, can be a daunting task, so it is certainly comforting to know that the university recruits professionals to specifically accommodate the transition. Based on this sentiment, I would easily say that this aspect of the presentation was the most important. Most students don't think to take full advantage of services provided, so awareness of what's available is crucial. Mrs. Cary handed out a brochure of types that detailed special events for the future, including things like resume bootcamps, mock interviews with professionals in many fields, and CareerFest. Extra help in matters like resume review, interview experience, etc. goes a long way, and it would be foolish to pass up these opportunities.

Another important presentation aspect to take note of was the specialized counselling appointments that can be made with the Career Center. These wide audience presentations are great for distributing general information, but to get the most assistance possible, these one-on-one appointments would offer a wealth of critical advice. The ability to sit down, free of charge, and receive personalized career advice from a paid professional is an opportunity that is too good to pass up. These appointments can serve a variety of purposes: resume/cover letter view, LinkedIn review and free professional profile shots, and so much more. I know I will certainly be taking full advantage of this experience in the coming months of job searching!
