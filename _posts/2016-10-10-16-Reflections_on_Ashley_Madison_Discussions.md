<i>Share your reaction to the Ashley Madison Case that we discussed in class this week.</i>

<hr>

This week in seminar class, we researched and discussed the Ashley Madison data breach from 2015. I had previously known much about it just by monitoring the event as it took place, as news passed through on Reddit. With the shear irony of such an event, of course the trolls of Reddit took to keeping everyone informed on the breach. 

And I am somewhat in agreeance with the trolls of the Internet. The irony of this data breach is absolutely hilarious. The fact that a promiscuous website, whose very product was secrecy and anonymity, was exposed via a massive data breach is quite comical. Now I'm not saying that I believe all the "well known public figures" that were exposed actually had ever used the site. It's quite likely that most of these profiles were made as a joke or for trolling purposes. Given that a huge amount of the accounts that were leaked proved to be women-imitating chatbots, there's probably no real exposing happening. 

What I found most interesting about this study was learning the motivation behind the hacking. The Impact Team published the data breach as a form of vigilantism to expose the extortion-driven account deletion policy of Ashley Madison. The company required users to pay money to delete their profiles, even if they were set up fraudulently without the true email owner's consent. Even if the account owners paid for this service, the premium service required the use of a credit card, and PCI standards require retention of card details long after the purchase date, so there was still plenty of paper-trail left for the website.

Discussion of ethics behind this data breach is rather interesting. I don't believe that two wrongs make a right. Just because the website was 'immoral' doesn't mean anyone is justified to take immoral action against them. But then again, if it's estabished that the website itself is 'immoral' than can any action taken against them be morally quantifiable?
