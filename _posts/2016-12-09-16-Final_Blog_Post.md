<i>Make a final blog post describing the three most important things you learned this semester and offer one piece of advice to students taking the class next semester.</i>

<hr>

Probably the first most important thing I have learned this semester is to put yourself out there, besides academic requirements. When crafting a resume and job searching, you'll find it easier and yourself much more impressive if you have a lot of extra-ciricular classes to discuss. Secondly, I enjoyed the interview requirement, and more importantly I enjoyed reading the reports everyone made. It's very comforting to see that everyone else is going through similar interview proecesses, and it's interesting to see how the interview processes varies from company to company. Lastly, the course prepared me to design my own work schedule. With the lax policy on due dates, it was really up to the individual student to motivate themselves and structure their time.

My most important piece of advice to offer to students taking the class next semester would be to manage your time well! Dr. Wilkes has been very kind in offering an accomodating work schedule (set at your own pace), so don't just put it off because it's not due yet, and it doesn't seem like much. Work quickly piles up in this class, so you need to stay on top of it, and you'll have a much easier, relaxing semester.
