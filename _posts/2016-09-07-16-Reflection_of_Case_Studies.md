<i>Topic: Make an entry in your blog reflecting on our discussions in class in which we applied ethical systems to specific scenarios. You might elaborate on things you did not get to talk about in class, give your overall impression of the discussion, identify the highlights of the discussion, or whatever you think would be of interest to others concerning our discussion.</i>

I felt the deepest discussion came from the ethical analysis of the DDOS attack scenario on the child pornography server. To my surprise, there was a pretty even division of opinion among our class. I felt most people would choose the socially conventional opinion, agreeing that it was a morally correct action. It's difficult to say exactly why I believe this to be the conventional opinion. Maybe because the idea of "two wrongs don't make a right" is often overlooked; we typically believe that immoral actions deserve any kind of retribution, even if the retribution itself is immoral. And while this may be too great of an assumption on my part, I believe this to be the natural tendency of human behavior, purely based on past observation.

As for my own opinion, I sought to argue (if only for the sake of being devil's advocate) that the action of DDOSing a child pornography server was immoral. For my logic in this decision-making I analyzed only the action (DDOSing) and not the victim (child pornography). In my line of thinking, the question could simply be posed as "is it morally correct to DDOS attack a _______"; the recipient was completely irrelevant. If the action itself is immoral by logic, then it does not matter what the action is imposed on. I found the action of DDOSing to be immoral, based on the ethical theory of Kantianism: the act of DDOSing robs both the owner's right to property and the client's right to accessibility.

It's very hard to discount the recipient of the action, considering the possession, access, or production of child pornography would be deemed immoral itself based on conventional laws and opinion. However, to follow a Kantianism approach properly we should remember that exceptions to the categorical imperative are not allowed, and in order to achieve a definitive ethical theory, this is line of thinking we need (one with little room for ambiguity). Now I'm not saying that this is the ideal society, where we would observe strict ethical guidelines, but I do believe that if we are ever to define a specific theory, ambiguity would not be allowed to exist.
