<i>Topic: Share thoughts about the presentation and discussion of the Hive Tracks and Blowing Rock Software case study.</i>

<hr>

It was certainly nice to hear Dr. James Wilkes's personal experiences with his company Blowing Rock Software and his application Hive Tracks, as well
as his involvement with the Bee Informed Partnership. It's one thing to speak of theoretical situations that might occur in the professional world,
but it is another to hear first hand experiences of overcoming obstacles. In this blog post, I'll attempt to highlight specific areas of the presentation
that prompt discussion.

Firstly, Dr. Wilkes established the importance of bees; while many might just these insects as a nuisance or even a phobia, they are first and foremost
a vital construct in our food production system and as such are also a lucrative business opportunity. Not only is their byproduct, honey, a useful and
much sought-after commodity, but I did not realize that agriculturalists would pay
to rent individual bee hives to pollenate their crops. It makes perfectly good sense that this would be a common practice, but I had always assumed this
to be taken care of through natural processes. However, it turns out that simply relying on nature is not enough, especially considering a series of large
declines in the bee population that have taken place over the last five years or so. 

Next, Dr. Wilkes elaborated on how his application Hive Tracks came into existence. After growing up on his father's beefarm, Dr. Wilkes carried on the
tradition starting around 2000. Being heavily involved with the rigors and challenges that come with beekeeping, he turned to his other passion, computer
science, to develop a technology which could act as a primary utility tool. This hits pretty close to home, because it is exactly the reason that got me
into computer science in the first place: I wanted to develop tools and instruments that would solve real-life problems, posed by people's interests. To
see a successful example of this solution development through technology is very motivational to my cause.

Finally, we wrapped up this discussion by formulating possible ethical scenarios that would evolve from in this area, specifically relating to the areas
of intellectual property, privacy, and security. Dr. Wilkes tasked us each with brainstorming different scenarios and he would discuss how each of those
areas related to his company, product, and position on the Bee Informed Partnership. These were possible issues that I brainstormed: 

* Bee Informed Partnership is a government sponsored (USDA and NIFA) group which seeks to better understand the declines in honey bee populations in the United States.
* Hive Tracks is a private company that sponsors cloud based digital solutions to assist in the tasks of an apiarist.
* By very nature, the two groups have conflicting interests: one has the mask of government research, while the other suits the demands of the consumer. 
* The question arises: can government money be used to fund/assist the efforts of a private company with development of consumer goods?
* Can these two groups share data gathered, even though one was obtained through tax payer money and the other through private investment?
* Does the company who gathers the data own the data and have exclusive rights to distribute it however they want?
* Further questions: can data obtained be used for purposes other than what it was collected for?
